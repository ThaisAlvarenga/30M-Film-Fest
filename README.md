# 30M-Film-Fest

## Description

### Concept and Theme:

## Process

### Home/Main Page

### Play Page

### Gallery 


### Team Page 
Additionally I wanted the appearance to be similar to the way people's cameras are showcased in Zoom, but at the same time, I also wanted to have an element that showcased how we have in a way re-shaped zoom to become part of our social environment. Thus I decided to change the shape of the rectangle on zoom for a circle. 

To give the design more character, I decided to make my own minimalistic drawings with a similar texture to the UI elements I did previously, instead of using screenshots from the video. At the end, I came up with this: 

<img src="images-documentation/team1.png" width="30%"> <img src="images-documentation/team2.png" width="30%"> <img src="images-documentation/team3.png" width="30%">
- I decided to use colors that would contrast with my orginal color palette and at the same time would also compliment some of the colors from the skin or clothes that the girls are wearing. 

### About Page

## Challenges

### To keep in mind for the future

- Improve my ability to place things and use grids to make the website responsive
- Being more tidy with the code 
- Having better transitions for some things.
- Trying to design for the phone screen first and then work my way up to desktop screen sizes. 
- Learn more javascript 
- I really like the hamburger navigation bar, I want to keep on building from it
- I didnâ€™t got to use animations, so I would like to do that sometime
