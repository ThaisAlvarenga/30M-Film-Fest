## Challenges

### To keep in mind for the future

- Improve my ability to place things and use grids to make the website responsive
- Being more tidy with the code 
- Having better transitions for some things.
- Trying to design for the phone screen first and then work my way up to desktop screen sizes. 
- Learn more javascript 
- I really like the hamburger navigation bar, I want to keep on building from it
- I didnâ€™t got to use animations, so I would like to do that sometime
